## Abstract: 
A room booking website that uses GET and POST fetch API's to arrange listings logically and allows various permutations of filters for the users.

### Technical pointers: 
- The data for this website is fetched from API endpoints. 
- Display is responsive across, small, medium, and large screens, including cell phones and tablets. 
- Testing was implemented with the Mocha framework and Chai library. 

## Installation Instructions 
- In order for this application to function, it will require accessing both our backend server repository as well as our front-end repository. 

### Client side Server Setup
- Fork [the backend](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/overlook-api) repository. 
- Clone it to your local machine using the command: `git clone git@github.com:turingschool-examples/overlook-api.git`.
- Run the command: `cd overlook-api`
- Run the command: `npm install`
- Run the command: `npm start`

### Client App Setup
- Open a separate tab in your terminal using `command T`
- Fork [the front end](https://github.com/taranveersingh93/overlook-project) repository. 
- Clone it to your local machine using the command: `git clone git@github.com:taranveersingh93/overlook-project.git`.
- Run the command: `cd overlook-project`
- Run the command: `npm install`

## Context: 
- Mod 2, Week 6: 
  - I'm a current student of Turing School of Software & Design. 
  - Turing is a 7 month program, which offers a total of 4 modules. 
  - A total of approximately 30 hours was spent on this project. 

## Learning Goals:
- Use array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.
- Create intuitive UI.
- Write DRY functions that follow SRP.
- Follow test driven development.
- Show efficient use of Error handling and display error feedbacks where appropriate.
- Ensure keyboard accessibility and screen responsiveness.
- Use semantic HTML and use different accessibility audits.
